      </p>
      <p>
        You understand and agree that Your unlimited access to the Content on
        the Website or in the Magazine represents a substantial portion of the
        value You receive from Your TaxGlobal’s Membership Fee. THEREFORE, TO

      </p>

      <h3>19. BREACH OF TERMS OF USE AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES</h3>
      <p>
        You understand that the content in each report or record on TaxGlobal
        has significant value to TaxGlobal and that the damage caused to
        TaxGlobal for any violation of these Terms of Use pertaining to a report
        or record will be difficult to accurately estimate. Thus, you shall be
        liable to pay us the following amounts as liquidated damages, and you
        agree that the liquidated damages are a reasonable estimate of
        TaxGlobal’s damages for the specified breaches of these Terms of Use:
      </p>
      <p>
        If you post Content in violation of these Terms of Use, you agree to
        promptly pay TaxGlobal One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) for each item of
        Content posted in violation of these Terms of Use. We may (but shall not
        be required to) to issue you a warning before assessing damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, sell, re-sell or exploit for
        any purpose any Content in violation of these Terms of Use, you agree to
        pay One Hundred Dollars ($100) for each record or report that you
        displayed, copied, duplicated, reproduced, sold, re-sold or exploited
        for any purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use computer programming routines that are intended to aggregate
        records or reports from the Sites and Services or otherwise damage,
        interfere with, disrupt, impair, disable or otherwise overburden the
        Sites and Services, you agree to pay One Hundred Dollars ($100) for each
        report or record that is aggregated, disrupted, damaged or otherwise
        affected by you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except as set forth in the foregoing subparagraphs (a) through (c),
        inclusive, you agree to pay the actual damages suffered by TaxGlobal,
        including, but not limited to attorneys’ fees and court costs, to the
        extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Notwithstanding
        any other provision of these Terms of Use, we reserve the right to seek
        the remedy of specific performance of any term contained herein, or a
        preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term
        or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in these Terms of Use, or
        any combination thereof.
      </p>

      <h3>20. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms of Use and other agreements, rules, and policies
        incorporated by reference to these Terms including, without limitation,
        the Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire agreement between you and
        TaxGlobal. It supersedes any prior or contemporaneous negotiations,
        discussions or agreements, whether written or oral, between you and
        TaxGlobal regarding the subject matter contained in these Terms of Use.
        Additional terms and conditions may exist between you and third parties,
        including but not limited to, Service Providers and others. You
        represent and warrant that those third-party agreements do not interfere
        with your obligations and duties to TaxGlobal under these Terms of Use.
      </p>

      <h3>21. MUTUAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Informal Negotiations. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of
          any dispute, controversy or claim, past, present, or future, between
          you and TaxGlobal, including without limitation any dispute or claim
          related to or arising out of this Agreement ("Dispute"), you and
          TaxGlobal may attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally (the
          "Informal Negotiations") before initiating any arbitration or court
          proceeding. Such Informal Negotiations will commence upon written
          notice. Your address for any notices under this Section is your
          physical address that you have provided to TaxGlobal. TaxGlobal's
          address for such notices is: TaxGlobal, d/b/a TaxGlobal, Attn: Legal
          Department, 5965 Village Way, Suite E105-611, San Diego, CA 92130.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arbitration. If a Dispute is not resolved through Informal
          Negotiations, you and TaxGlobal agree to resolve any and all Disputes
          (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) through final and
          binding arbitration ("Arbitration Agreement"). This Arbitration
          Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and
          evidences a transaction involving commerce. The arbitration will be
          commenced and conducted before a single arbitrator under the
          Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of the American
          Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's
          Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer
          Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website (www.adr.org).
          Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will
          be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the
          AAA Consumer Rules). If you are unable to pay such costs, TaxGlobal
          will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. Each party will pay the
          fees for his/her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to
          which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. The
          arbitrator will make a decision in writing. Additionally, the
          arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency,
          shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to
          the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of
          this Arbitration Agreement. However, the preceding sentence shall not
          apply to the "Class Action Waiver" described in Subsection (4) below.

          Excluded Disputes. You and TaxGlobal agree that the following Disputes
          are excluded from this Arbitration Agreement: (1) any Dispute seeking
          to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or
          our intellectual property rights; (2) individual claims in small
          claims court; (3) any claim that an applicable federal statute
          expressly states cannot be arbitrated; and (4) any claim for
          injunctive relief.
        </li>
        <li>
          WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION.
          To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, You and TaxGlobal
          agree to bring any Dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only,
          and not as a class or collective action. There will be no right or
          authority for any Dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a
          class or collective action ("Class Action Waiver"). Regardless of
          anything else in this Arbitration Agreement and/or the applicable AAA
          Rules or AAA Consumer Rules, the interpretation, applicability,
          enforceability or formation of the Class Action Waiver may only be
          determined by a court and not an arbitrator.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rules/Standards Governing Arbitration Proceeding. A party who wishes
          to arbitrate a Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement must
          initiate an arbitration proceeding no later than the expiration of the
          statute of limitations that applicable law prescribes for the claim
          asserted. The arbitrator shall apply the statute of limitations that
          would have applied if the Dispute had been brought in court. The
          arbitrator may award any remedy to which a party is entitled under
          applicable law, but remedies shall be limited to those that would be
          available to a party in their individual capacity, and no remedies
          that otherwise would be available to an individual under applicable
          law will be forfeited. The arbitrator is without authority to apply
          any different substantive law. The parties have the right to conduct
          adequate civil discovery and present witnesses and evidence as needed
          to present their cases and defenses, and any dispute in this regard
          shall be decided by the arbitrator. The location of the arbitration
          proceeding shall take place in the city or county where you reside,
          unless each party agrees otherwise. A court of competent jurisdiction
          shall have the authority to enter judgment upon the arbitrator's
          decision/award.

        <li>
          Severability. You and TaxGlobal agree that if any portion of this
          Section entitled "Mutual Arbitration Agreement" is found illegal or
          unenforceable, that portion will be severed, and the remainder of this
          Section will be given full force and effect.

        laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any choice or
        conflict of law provision or rule (either of the State of California or
        any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of
